# JavaScript Warm-Up Project

## Overview
This project is focused on understanding the basics of JavaScript scripting. Through a series of practical exercises, I implemented various tasks that explore JavaScript fundamentals like variables, loops, functions, and object manipulation. Each file in this repository represents a standalone solution to a specific problem, showcasing my understanding and application of JavaScript concepts.

## What I Did

### 1. **Printing Strings**
   - Created a script to print a constant string using `console.log`.
   - Explored string concatenation and dynamic value printing.

### 2. **Handling Command-Line Arguments**
   - Built scripts to handle and interpret command-line arguments.
   - Implemented logic to provide meaningful output based on the number of arguments passed.

### 3. **Loops and Iterations**
   - Used loops (both `for` and `while`) to iterate over arrays and repeat tasks.
   - Generated output dynamically based on input values.

### 4. **Functions**
   - Defined and used reusable functions for operations like addition and factorial computation.
   - Implemented recursion for factorial calculations.

### 5. **Conditionals and Error Handling**
   - Utilized `if` and `else` statements to control program flow.
   - Implemented checks to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

### 6. **Working with Objects**
   - Manipulated object properties and added methods dynamically.
   - Updated object values and demonstrated changes in output.

### 7. **Working with Data Structures**
   - Used arrays to store and process strings and numbers.
   - Extracted and sorted numerical data from command-line arguments to find the second largest number.

### 8. **Modularity**
   - Exported and imported functions across files to demonstrate modular JavaScript.
   - Built a file to handle addition and reused it in other scripts.

### 9. **Dynamic Behavior**
   - Wrote a script to increment object properties dynamically.
   - Demonstrated scope and variable management through practical examples.

## Lessons Learned
- Gained hands-on experience with JavaScript fundamentals, including variable declarations (`let`, `const`), loops, and conditional statements.
- Improved understanding of modular programming and the importance of reusable code.
- Explored recursion and its application in solving mathematical problems like factorials.
- Learned how to handle user inputs and edge cases effectively.

## Challenges
- Ensuring compliance with `semistandard` coding style.
- Managing scope effectively, especially when working with global and block-scoped variables.
- Handling unexpected inputs gracefully without using complex error handling mechanisms.

## Files
Each file corresponds to a task or a feature implemented during the project:

- `3-value_argument.js`: Prints the first argument passed to the script.
- `4-concat.js`: Concatenates and prints two arguments.
- `5-to_integer.js`: Converts and prints integers from arguments.
- `6-multi_languages_loop.js`: Prints lines using a loop.
- `7-multi_c.js`: Repeats a string based on input count.
- `8-square.js`: Prints a square of `X` characters.
- `9-add.js`: Performs addition using a custom function.
- `10-factorial.js`: Calculates factorial using recursion.
- `11-second_biggest.js`: Finds the second largest number from input.
- `12-object.js`: Modifies an object property.
- `13-add.js`: Exports a function to add two numbers.
- `100-let_me_const.js`: Modifies a global variable.
- `101-call_me_moby.js`: Executes a function `x` times.
- `102-add_me_maybe.js`: Increments and calls a function.
- `103-object_fct.js`: Adds a method to an object to increment its value.

## Conclusion
This project helped me develop a strong foundation in JavaScript scripting and problem-solving. Each task incrementally introduced new concepts, reinforcing my understanding of the language and its capabilities. The knowledge gained here will serve as a basis for more advanced JavaScript projects, including front-end development and dynamic web applications.
