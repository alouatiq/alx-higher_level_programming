# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. It covers the basics of control flow and functions in Python.

## Files

* `0-positive_or_negative.py`: Print whether a random number is positive or negative.
* `1-last_digit.py`: Print the last digit of a random number.
* `2-print_alphabet.py`: Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase.
* `3-print_alphabt.py`: Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e'.
* `4-print_hexa.py`: Print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
* `5-print_comb2.py`: Print numbers from 00 to 99.
* `6-print_comb3.py`: Print all possible different combinations of two digits.
* `7-islower.py`: Check for lowercase characters.
* `8-uppercase.py`: Print a string in uppercase.
* `9-print_last_digit.py`: Print the last digit of a number.
* `10-add.py`: Add two integers and return the result.
* `11-pow.py`: Compute a to the power of b and return the value.
* `12-fizzbuzz.py`: Print the numbers from 1 to 100 (Fizz Buzz).
* `13-insert_number.c`: C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
* `lists.h`: Header file for the C program.
* `100-print_tebahpla.py`: Print the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
* `101-remove_char_at.py`: Create a copy of the string, removing the character at position n.
* `102-magic_calculation.py`: Python function that matches given Python bytecode.

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
Complete the source code to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

### 1. The last digit
Complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

### 5. 00...99
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### 7. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

### 8. To uppercase
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. a ^ b
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

### 12. Fizz Buzz
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

### 13. Insert in sorted linked list
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### 14. Smile in the mirror
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.

### 15. Remove at position
Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n.

### 16. ByteCode -> Python #2
Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):` that does exactly the same as the given Python bytecode.
